ðŸ“° Flutter News App
A Flutter mobile application that fetches and displays news articles from a public REST API. Built as part of a technical task to demonstrate skills in Flutter, GetX state management, Firebase Authentication, and responsive UI design.

ðŸ“² Features
âœ… Firebase Authentication

Login via Email/Password


âœ… News Feed

Fetches articles from a public REST API

Displays headlines, images, descriptions, and full article details

âœ… Search

Search articles by keyword

âœ… Responsive UI

Optimized layouts for various screen sizes

Custom ResponsiveConfig ensures spacing, padding, and sizing adapt fluidly

âœ… State Management

Implemented using GetX for:

Reactive UI updates

Navigation

Controller logic

ðŸ›  Architecture & Implementation
State Management: GetX

Lightweight, reactive approach to manage view logic and navigation

REST API: NewsAPI.org

Articles are fetched using an HTTP client

Parsing is done using models

Authentication:

FirebaseAuth handles login/signup

Abstracted into LoginService class

Search:

Users can search headlines in real-time

UI Layer:

CustomField, PasswordField, and responsive spacing ensure clean UI

ResponsiveConfig dynamically adjusts layout based on screen size

ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation
âœ… Email/Password login flow tested with Firebase

âœ… API integration returns valid JSON responses

âœ… Search articles in real time

âœ… Layout adapts across emulators with different screen sizes





Implementation Approach

The project follows a modular and scalable architecture, aiming for clean separation of concerns:

Authentication is handled through a dedicated LoginService, which interacts with FirebaseAuth. This abstraction simplifies the login/signup logic and allows easy testing and future extensibility.

State management is implemented using GetX, allowing reactive UI updates and clean separation between UI, logic, and navigation. Controllers are scoped per screen to ensure minimal coupling.

API integration uses an HTTP client to fetch articles from NewsAPI. Models are defined for parsing the JSON response, and error handling is done to ensure graceful UI fallback.

UI components like CustomField and PasswordField are reused across screens for consistency. Layout adapts fluidly using a custom ResponsiveConfig class that ensures padding and sizing adjust based on screen dimensions.

Search functionality is implemented within the controller layer to filter articles in real time as the user types.

Folder structure is organized by feature, keeping logic modular and easy to navigate.
